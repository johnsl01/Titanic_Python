        "The Pclass column is the passenger class - the ship was divided into three different classes - 1st, 2nd and 3rd.  1st class passengers had luxurious cabins, they had open access to the upper decks and to the luxurious 'state' rooms of the ship - they were generally wealthier and as well as some having brought personal staff with them they had a lot of the ship's crew dedicated to their care.  We should expect that this will be a factor in survival - access and crew deference being significant factors. 2nd class had individual cabins but less deck access and restricted access to some areas.  3rd class passengers generally were below decks - had dormitory type accomodation and were packed in pretty tight - they did not have much deck access and were unable to get into much of the 1st and 2nd class areas.\n",

This is text data so while we will want to make use of it we have to be careful in how we processes it - we will definitely want to pull out the title as that will help us in some cases with filling in the missing ages - and we will make some use of the name information to try and derive some information to help us with understanding what size of a party each passenger was likely in.\n",

        "\n",
        "Age is self explanatory - it has a lot of missing values - we will look at mechanisms for filling in these values from the rest of the data, we expect that age will be a factor in survival - but need to explore how it affects it - expectation is probably that the elderly may have been less likely to survive - but despite being less able we expect the young may have survived both from having an adult caring for them and from the 'women and children first' policy - which is as yet unvalidated."
