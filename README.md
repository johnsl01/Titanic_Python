# Titanic_Python

iPython notebook to explore the titanic survivors problem

The titanic survivors problem is a relatively simple one to understand but it 
still has enough data complexiy to be used to showcase or serve as a learning 
base for quite a lot of processes and tools in Machine Learning and Artificial 
Intelligence - albeit that the more sophisticated tools in this case don't usually 
return any better answeres than the simplest ones.

I originally used this problem as part of a ML & AI course which was based on R.  So
this iPython notebook is my ongoing attempt to reproduce and extend this to python.
